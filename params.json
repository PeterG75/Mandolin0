{"name":"Mandolin0","tagline":"A web form bruteforce tool based on templating","body":"### Introduction.\r\nMandolin0 is a web form bruteforcing tool created with the aims to be very performant and easy to use. It is based on the concept of Template and Oracle, this will help not experienced people to use the tool without the needed knowledge of how to setup the login HTTP Post (this of course isn't an excute to not learn hot the things work).\r\n\r\nYou can download a compiled version here.\r\n\r\n### What are Template and Oracle \r\n**Template** is an abstract HTTP request that are used by a given website to login a user. The aim of the project is to provide templates for the most common used open source platform, in order to avoid to known how to bruteforce a given application. However if you have to bruteforce a custom application you have to create a custom template. All template are stored in the **Templates** directory. You need to edit the template file and insert the placeholder **{USERNAME}** and **{PASSWORD}** at the correct place. See the Default template (located at Templates/Default/Default.txt) to better understand how a template works.\r\n\r\n**Oracle** is used to known if a given test has successful discovered the password or not. It is an XML file where you can configure a list of text that must be matched or not. See the Default oracle (located at Oracles/Default/Default.txt) to better understand how a oracle works.\r\n\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
